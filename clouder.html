</div>
<div class="cs-summary">
  <p  class="cs-cldr">In the music industry there’s a need to create, collaborate and share concepts, ideas and data.<br>
When people are in a room together or worlds apart, sharing data is as easy as a click of a button, while the former two (create and collaborate) aren’t as simple.<br><br>
With the advent of technology and communication platforms creation and collaboration should be easier, when people are worlds apart.<br><br>
Clouder aims to meet the data capacity of all file types, the ability to create content inside the application with more than one user, all while able to collaborate in a safe and secure place.

</div>
<h2 class="cs-cldr">THE PROBLEM </h2>
<p  class="cs-cldr"> The challenge we ran into was that there weren’t any
  limitations on how far I could push the overall project.
Our main constraint was the lack of direction that Clouder
wanted to go in.<br>
Effectively we could have moved in any
direction which lends itself to scope-creep.
Building out an entire brand from scratch required a long
list of tasks and tools to be used in building the whole
company from the bottom up,  took a lot of time and a
plethora of platforms to build the project.</p>

<img src="assets/pages/cs-clouder/foundpuzzle.svg" alt="Found Puzzle Piece">
</div>
<h2 class="cs-cldr"> THE SOLUTION </h2>
<p class="cs-cldr">Conducting user research and constantly utilising preference
  testing proved to be our biggest asset in making decisions
  about direction and deliverables.<br>
  Through this technique I pinpointed our target market and
  built out from there, creating a site that offers storage,
  sharing opportunities,creation and collaboration. <br>
  From sign in to upload, I have created a site that was easy
  and productive.</p>

</div>
    <section class="user-surveys">
    <h2 class="cs-cldr"> USER SURVEYS </h2>
    <p class="cs-cldr">I started with user surveys to gather what our target audience would be,
      by gathering my survey takers from personal contacts, social media
      and forum platforms.<br>
      It was important that I targeted as many cloud storage users that I knew I
      could find, so that I could learn more about what  worked and what didn’t.<br><br>

      <strong>I needed some key information, such as:</strong><br><br>

        - What features were most important to a user?<br>
        - Why a user was having to use more than one cloud storage service?<br>
        - When were they using cloud storage <em>(personal, business, both)</em>?<br>
        - Where were their frustrations with their current services? and;<br>
        - How their current experience with cloud storage could be improved upon.<br></p>
      </section>


        <div class="survey-results-box">
          <ul class="Survey-Results">
        <li><strong>30% </strong>  of non-users didn’t use cloud storage because it lacks features they want?</li><br>
        <li><strong>34% </strong>  of users use multiple platforms to access their data</li><br>
        <li><strong>50% </strong>  of people paid for cloud storage</li><br>
        <li><strong>65% </strong>  of users used more than one service for cloud storage</li><br>
        <li><strong>75% </strong>  of users choose their app/s because of features</li><br>
        <li><strong>84% </strong>  said it was important to collaborate and create inside storage space</li><br>
        <li><strong>87% </strong>  said that accessing a cloud storage service from their app was important</li><br>
        <li><strong>91% </strong>  believed they may be more successful if they could collaborate</ul>
      </div>

      <section class="user-surveys"> <!---user surveys continued-->
      <p class="cs-cldr">After analyzing the data from the survey. I learned that a critical number of
        cloud storage users were unhappy with their main service, because it didn’t
        provide them with enough room for creation and collaboration that would warrant
        paying for a service just to house data.<br></br>

        It was clear that users were using multiple cloud storage services to target
        specific actions, but weren’t able to find a service that would house all
        their needs into one service.<br></p>

        <section class="comp-analysis">
        <h2 class="cs-cldr"> COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS </h2>
        <p class="cs-cldr">I wanted to see what companies not only held data,
          but curated it - allowing users to share, create and collaborate in the service.<br><br>


          I put 5 companies under the microscope:<br></p>
          <div class="comp-ana">
                <ul>
                  <li><em>- Patreon</em></li>

                </ul><br>
              </div>

        <p class="cs-cldr">With Google Drive and Dropbox being the most well-known of the five, their combined
          limitations on file types and size left a user for wanting more.<br>
        Meanwhile Patreon and Soundcloud offered a platform for showcasing their data so
        others could contact the user for collaboration or creation,
        but lacked a backend storage facility.</br>
        Splice was geared towards production and recording but also didn’t offer much in the
        way of storage or creation inside the application.</p>

              From these stories, I developed user flows to create a visual hierachy and

                After sketching the bones on paper we mocked them into a prototype to begin our
                first round of usability testing.<br><br>

                I played with 4-UP sketching before jumping into more vivid versions.<br>
                This opportunity to play so freely with paper and pencil offered up a natural
                tendency to sketch without thinking too hard about previous designs while
                allowing some imagination to run free with possibilities.</p>

                    The final logo is representative of the keywords I wanted to create as the brands values
                    and simple enough to be timeless.<br>
                    This simplicity gives the logo the ability to be translated into various colors

                      they want and need, and what truely appeals to them. This priceless tool of testing,
                      offers up a wealth of knowledge far beyond what simple education and intuition will
                      provide.<br><br>

                      Upon preference testing I chose Sans Source Pro and Barlow as the main type faces.
                      These two are recognizable and therefore trustworthy.<br><br>

                  <p class="cs-cldr">Alike the rest of the site, I wanted to keep the colors basic so that the user could
                      input their own magic when their creativity sparked was a key factor. <br>
                      I initially applied red for a highlighter, reresenting “fire”, “creativity”, “passion”,
                      “drive” and “desire”, but upon my first round of usability testing, feedback suggeted
                      that red was “alerting: the users more than drawing their attention. <br><br>
                      Upon mocking up our high fidelity prototype, I acknowledged that the red was creating
                      an alert/problem.<br>
                      It was changed to a creative, trustworthy, calming blue.<br><br>

                    <p class="cs-cldr">I opted for no animation and simple signs to direct our users to their appropriate
                      destination.
                      Keeping the site uncluttered and free from complications due to misreading icons and
                      their meanings we kept with universal themes such as download, upload, trash(bin),
                      document etc.<br><br>

                      I wanted minimal images, so as not to take away from a users own creative endeavors,
                      however when imagery was used, I wanted it to be clear about delivering a message.<br>
                      Wether it was a man sitting at an airport with a laptop to suggest accesiblity on
                      the go or a stack of books as a metaphor for filing.</p>

                      <p class="cs-cldr">Feedback from my first round of users, there was a heavy focus on the visuals of
                        the landing page, and that although they could see that it was a cloud storage site,
                        they didn’t think the images were broad enough to include the average user and
                        therefore would not be engaged by the site unless they were a live musician.<br><br>

                        Alike my search for a prefered typography choice, I deployed preference tests
                        into forums and usability hub to gather feedback on what people prefered.<br><br>
                        I wanted to introduce the site to musicians as a home for their creation,
                        collaboration and sharing, but also didn’t want to ostracize other user who would
                        like to use those features in their other endeavors.<br><br>

                        Users wanted clearer imagery about what the company was meant to achieve (Hero image),
                        and wanted to see images that were more concise and less metaphorical.<br><br> 
                        I gave the words and images more space to breathe. </p>

                  <h2 class="cs-cldr"> VISUAL DESIGN : HOVER BUTTON </h2>
                  <p class="cs-cldr">Synthesizing the feedback from these tests helped to ensure that each revision to the
                    design was borne out of improving usability and not just aesthetics.<br><br>

                    Some of the greatest feedback came was to highlight the menu and drop down iconography for
                     users who weren’t aware of the burger menu or dropdown feature.<br>
                     To combat confusion and frustration I implemented a hover button when the mouse hovers
                     over the icons that weren’t as apparent to the user - this proved successful in our
                     second round of testing. </p>

          <h1 class="cs-cldr"> CONCLUSION </h1>
        </div>
          <p class="cs-cldr">Clouder is a project that is close to my heart. Throughout the process,
            my greatest takeaway was the value of user research and testing.<br>
            As a tool these two actions of study and listening cannot be underestimated in
            creating structures and experiences that cater to the greater person than just
            to rely on previous studies or personal experiences.<br>
            Through this process I was able to design a product that was user based and user driven,
            while my key takeaway was to keep it simple and use the testing and research to
            speak for itself before being carried away with complexities.<br><br>

            Thinking forward, with more time I would have liked to build out additional screens
            to test the concept of forums for users. I would have liked to build more options
            for a collaborative space and run user preference and testing.<br>
            My biggest challenge was in choosing and curating the imagery (albeit minimal).
            I overthought, and as aforementioned learned that keeping it simple is the key.<br><br>

            As a whole, I am excited about this project and the insights I learned in the process.
            The solutions that were rendered came from an organic place to create a solution to
            the world of cloud storage.<br>
             This project proved to be challenging and fun, offering up a wealth of knowledge that
            I am looking forward to blueprinting and drafting further in my future projects.</p>
