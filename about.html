                        I’ve always had a <strong>love for design</strong>, for people, for solutions.<br>
                        My run-of-the-mill family includes interior designers, architects, business owners and crazies
                        <em>(we all need a good sprinkle every now and again)</em>, so it certainly isn’t hard to find
                        copies of ‘architectural digest’ blended in with all the design and art books scattered over my family home.</br>
                        The first real renderings of design <strong>started virtually</strong> for me <em>(back when the internet was considered a dangerous place to meet strangers)</em><br><br>

                        "Back in the day" I was an <strong>online forum moderator</strong> and contributor learning about plenty of new people
                        from all over the world while learning to use HTML.<br>
                        HHR - Hip Hop Revolution, my online family.<br><br>

                        I would spend hours learning commands <strong>to help</strong> build the forums and render the skills to make cool
                        one-of-a-kind footers for <strong>my online “family”</strong>.<br>
                        I crafted personalized avatars and racked countless hours as a feedback master to my fellow forum friends.
                        I wasn’t aware that these simple skills would also render themselves when I <strong>started learning UX/UI</strong>. <br><br>

                  <p class="about-story">My educational background includes a BA in contemporary music, which has taught me my
                    greatest skill above all. <strong>Listening</strong>.<br><br>
                  Creating music was a passion, and I fell in love with A&R. (Artists & Repertoire)<br>
                  A field that is responsible for <strong>art and business development</strong>. I enjoyed marketing and branding, building business,
                   analyzing data, creating <strong>strategic plans</strong> for execution and being part of team.<br><br>
                  Part of that process was listening, not to music, but to people and what they wanted and needed.
                   I wrote music for other people to perform but I also wrote branding and marketing plans for artists to
                   introduce and thrive in the industry.<br>
                  The desire to be part of a project, <strong>creating change</strong> and succeeding with people really revved my engines.<br><br>

                  <p class="about-story">My journey to get to the here and now may not look like much, but each and every step
                    brought me a little closer and added a new layer of insight.
                  I’ve lived in Australia, the UK, France and the <strong>USA</strong>. Although this pales in comparison to the places I’ve visited,
                  being able to learn new cultures and languages is at the forefront of my learnings. </br>
                  Meanwhile taking up work in
                  many countries has served me in my <strong>character building</strong> and in my experience as a human being.<br><br>
                  I’ve worn <strong>many hats</strong>, so when I worked in <strong>hospitality</strong> it came in handy when attempting to please a wide range of people.
                  Because of my burning desire to learn - the more I education and skills I armed myself with the more I could be of service.<br>
                  It was through <strong>customer service</strong>  that taught me how to be a clear communicator, in all my actions.
                  This was paramount to problem solving, especially when working with other people.
                  So when I began to build my own <strong>small business</strong>, I honed my skills in being detail oriented.<br><br>
                  It was by paying attention to detail, big and small, that the magic could be found and was the foundation of the business.
                  And <strong>stage coaching</strong>, for which I take great pride. Working with a vast amount of people taught me to listen, but more so hear.<br>
                  Hearing people is a act unlike any other, it gives allows people to be heard and <strong>feel valued</strong>.<br> It offers
                  the listener to be able to arm themselves with information to move forward.<br><br>
                  It was through stage coaching that gave credence in the ability I have as a visionary to inspire and <strong>motivate</strong> others to
                   think big > About themselves, about their abilities and the possibilities. And in turn this gave me hope about myself.<br><br>

                    creating who I am as a person and as a designer. Though it hasn’t always been “rainbows and unicorns” along the way,
                    each post in the adventure has served as an <strong>opportunity to grow</strong>.<br><br>
                    My "life's too short" and <strong>yes-we-can</strong> attitude allows me to attack problems with a creative mindset, in the same way as I coach.
                    There’s yet to be a battle I cannot face, and so with UX ad product design - I am setting ablaze the
                    torch to lead the way in <strong>creating change through empathetic experiences</strong>.<br><br>
