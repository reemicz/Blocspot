                        I’ve always had a love for design, for people, for solutions.<br>
                        My run-of-the-mill family includes interior designers, architects, business owners and crazies
                        <em>(we all need a good sprinkle every now and again)</em>, so it certainly isn’t hard to find
                        copies of ‘architectural digest’ blended in with all the design and art books scattered over my family home.
                        The first real renderings of design started virtually for me <em>(back when the internet was considered a dangerous place to meet strangers)</em><br><br>

                        "Back in the day" I was an online forum moderator and contributor learning about plenty of new people
                        from all over the world while learning to use HTML.<br>
                        HHR - Hip Hop Revolution, my online family.<br><br>

                        I would spend hours learning commands to help build the forums and  render the skills to make cool
                        one-of-a-kind footers for my online “family”.<br>
                        I crafted personalized avatars and racked countless hours as a feedback master to my fellow forum friends.
                        I wasn’t aware that these simple skills would also render themselves when I started learning UX/UI. <br><br>

                  <p class="about-story">My educational background includes a BA in contemporary music, which has taught me my
                    greatest skill above all. Listening.<br><br>
                  Creating music was a passion, and I fell in love with A&R. (Artists & Repertoire)<br>
                  A field that is responsible for art and business development. I enjoyed marketing and branding, building business,
                   analyzing data, creating strategic plans for execution and being part of team.<br><br>
                  Part of that process was listening, not to music, but to people and what they wanted and needed.
                   I wrote music for other people to perform but I also wrote branding and marketing plans for artists to
                   introduce and thrive in the industry.<br>
                  The desire to be part of a project, creating change and succeeding with people really revved my engines.<br><br>

                  <p class="about-story">My journey to get to the here and now may not look like much, but each and every step
                    brought me a little closer and added a new layer of insight.
                  I’ve lived in Australia, the UK, France and the USA. Although this pales in comparison to the places I’ve visited,
                  being able to learn new cultures and languages is at the forefront of my learnings. Meanwhile taking up work in
                  many countries has served me in my character building and in my experience as a human being.<br><br>
                  I’ve worn many hats, so when I worked in hospitality it came in handy when attempting to please a wide range of people.
                  Because of my burning desire to learn - the more I education and skills I armed myself with the more I could be of service.<br>
                  It was through customer service  that taught me how to be a clear communicator, in all my actions.
                  This was paramount to problem solving, especially when working with other people.
                  So when I began to build my own  small business, I honed my skills in being detail oriented.<br><br>
                  It was by paying attention to detail, big and small, that the magic could be found and was the foundation of the business.
                  And stage coaching, for which I take great pride. Working with a vast amount of people taught me to listen, but more so hear.<br>
                  Hearing people is a act unlike any other, it gives allows people to be heard and feel valued and offers
                  the hearer to be able to arm themselves with information to move forward.<br><br>
                  It was through stage coaching that gave credence in the ability I have as a visionary to inspire and motivate others to
                   think big. About themselves, about their abilities and the possibilities. And in turn this gave me hope about myself.<br><br>

                    creating who I am as a person and as a designer. Though it hasn’t always been “rainbows and unicorns” along the way,
                    each post in the adventure has served as an opportunity to grow.<br><br>
                    My go-getter outlook on life and "can-do" attitude allows me to  attack problems with a creative mindset, in the same way as I coach.
                    There’s yet to be a battle I cannot face, and so with UX - I am setting ablaze the
                    touch to lead the way in creating change through empathetic experiences.<br><br>

                      to real problems, I always aim to add more value by adding good design and an innovative experience into all that I do.<br><br>
