# My Portfolio

A showcase of my work from the program.

June 14: Finally got some amazing help from Anwar Montasir - who thoughtfully recorded a video about what he thought of my current progress and where he thought I should be going. His instruction is priceless and the weight from frustration that almost felt insurmountable was slowly starting to lift.

I have spent 9 hours going over new lessons and learnings and have felt for the first time that I may be able to get through this process. I know other students have felt the same and sorely disappointed but don't want to throw any person/s under the bus for their lack of direction or clarity within the group of mentors/markers/graders who are giving different points of view and direction.

Notes on today's work: I learned the value of SVG's PNG's and JPEG's (JPG) and why they are utilised in different ways. Tomorrow I am hoping to finalize the home page and power into the casestudy.
I have changed all the SVG's into PNGs (for transparency) and am excited about moving forward. A huge thank you goes to Anwar Montasir for his time - I am grateful and looking forward to moving forward with your help.
